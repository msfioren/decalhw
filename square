def squarevals(lis):
    lis = [2,3,4] #could also not have set values for lis and then at the end call this function with certain values to test
    lis2 = []
    for i in lis:
       lis2.append(i**2) #iniially i tried to modify the original list, but i thought it would be easier to just create a new list so as to not delete data from the old one
    print(lis2) #this code seems to be compiling correctly, so I'm confused as to why it doesn't print!
